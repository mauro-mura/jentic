## [Unreleased]

## [0.12.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- **Reflection Pattern (ADR-012)**: Introduced `ReflectionStrategy` and `ReflectionBehavior` for the Generate → Critique → Revise loop.
  - `ReflectionStrategy`, `CritiqueResult`, and `ReflectionConfig` added to `jentic-core` as core abstractions.
  - `DefaultReflectionStrategy` and `ReflectionBehavior` added to `jentic-runtime` for LLM-backed self-critique.
- **Reflection Example**: Added `ReflectionExample` demonstrating the self-correction loop in `jentic-examples`.
- **Documentation**: New dedicated guide for `ReflectionBehavior` and updated `mkdocs.yml` navigation.

### Changed
- **Project Structure**: Expanded ADR documentation with ADR-012 and updated README with Support and Development sections.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **Configuration-driven package scanning**: `JenticRuntime` now uses `getAllScanPackages()` from configuration for agent discovery.

### Changed
- **Configuration Guide**: Clarified builder method behavior and unchecked `ConfigurationException` handling in documentation.
- **Exception Hierarchy (BREAKING CHANGE)**: Restructured all core exceptions (LLM, Persistence, Memory, Embedding) to inherit from `JenticException` (a `RuntimeException`) and moved them to their respective functional packages (e.g., `dev.jentic.core.persistence`).
- **Configuration Loading**: Simplified `ConfigurationLoader` API by removing explicit checked `ConfigurationException` from `loadFromFile`.
- **Validation Logic**: Improved configuration validation in `JenticRuntime.Builder`, ensuring invalid configurations are caught early.

### Fixed
- **Documentation Workflows**: Fixed table formatting in ADR index and link formatting in documentation deployment workflows.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added
- **`LLMMemoryAware` interface** in `dev.jentic.core.llm`: marker interface that allows any `Agent` implementor (including those that cannot extend `LLMAgent`) to receive an injected `LLMMemoryManager` from the runtime. `LLMAgent` now implements this interface; `JenticRuntime` injects via `LLMMemoryAware` instead of `instanceof LLMAgent`.
- **`AgentContext` support** for plain `Agent` implementations and improved runtime agent creation.
- **LLM-based summarization** in `SummarizationStrategy` for context window management.
- Promotion of `KnowledgeStore` and `EmbeddingProvider` from adapters to core/runtime for broader availability.

### Fixed
- Increased timing thresholds in `ParallelBehaviorTest` and `SequentialBehaviorTest` for CI reliability.
- Use of dedicated `CachedThreadPool` in test behaviors to prevent ForkJoinPool starvation on CI.

### Changed
- Update of LLM integration guide with new summarization and knowledge store features.
- Updated Logback to version `1.5.32`.
- Updated AssertJ to version `3.27.7`.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added
- "Getting Started" guide and documentation index.
- GitHub Actions workflow for automatic documentation deployment.
- Test coverage for `jentic-adapters` module.
- Support for detailed Javadoc annotations and usage examples in Jentic annotations.

### Fixed
- Synchronization in `ratelimit` to prevent limit overruns in concurrency scenarios.
- Broken links in README.md file.
- Path normalization in documentation deployment workflow.

### Changed
- Optimization of Maven Javadoc configuration.
- Standardization of link formatting throughout documentation.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added
- Complete documentation for all behavior types.
- README "Learning Path" for `jentic-examples` module.

### Changed
- Refactoring of examples for a more linear structure and pattern-oriented naming.
- Replacement of `ConfigurationLoader` class with a cleaner interface.
- Improvement of `SimpleBehaviorScheduler` to handle additional behavior types.

### Fixed

- Simplification of agent registration in `BatchProcessing` example.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-02-24

### Fixed
- Improvement of `STOPPING` state validation in `LifecycleManagerTest`.
- More robust handling of asynchronous operations in the agent lifecycle.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **Bill of Materials (BOM)** module for centralized version management.
- Support for **A2A (Agent-to-Agent)** protocol with Jetty/HTTP-based implementation.
- LLM integration pattern: **Orchestrator-Workers**.
- **Support Chatbot** example with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and TF-IDF semantic search.
- Support for **Automatic-Module-Name** (JPMS) in all modules.
- Extended test framework with JaCoCo coverage and new unit tests for core, runtime, and adapters.
- Code of Conduct and Security Policy.

### Fixed
- Handling of NaN/negative values in system metrics.
- Race condition in agent registration during startup.
- Various fixes in timing tests (ScheduledBehavior, WakerBehavior).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **LLM Memory Management** system with automatic context injection.
- Strategies for Context Window management in AI agents.
- `AIAgent` base class to facilitate development of agents with LLM support.
- Integration of `MemoryStore` into `JenticRuntime`.

### Changed
- Moved `LLMMemoryManager` responsibility directly into `LLMAgent`.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-07

### Added
- **Agent Evaluation Framework** for agent testing and validation.
- Full implementation of dialogue protocols: **ContractNet, Query, Request**.
- Support for utilities to convert dialogues into A2A messages.
- A2A integration example.

### Changed
- Refactoring of `ContractNet` example to use `JenticRuntime`.

## [0.4.0] - 2025-11-20

### Added
- **Jentic Web Console**: web interface for agent monitoring and management.
- Support for message history storage with dedicated REST API.
- CLI tools for message monitoring and watching.
- `MessageSnifferAgent` for passive traffic monitoring.
- `AIAssistantAgent` example with LLM-based tool execution.

### Fixed

- Uptime calculation in `RestAPIHandler`.

## [0.3.0] - 2025-11-04

### Added
- Integration with LLM providers: **OpenAI, Anthropic, and Ollama**.
- Support for streaming, function calling, and LLM request/response logging.
- `ResearchTeam` example with agent collaboration and dynamic discovery.
- `baseUrl` configuration for LLM providers (support for proxies and local LLMs).

### Fixed
- Metadata loss in `AgentDescriptor`.
- NPE in handling null content in `OpenAIProvider`.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-27

### Added
- Support for **YAML Configuration**.
- New Behavior types:
  - `BatchBehavior`: batch processing by size or time.
  - `RetryBehavior`: retry strategies with backoff.
  - `CircuitBreakerBehavior`: resilience patterns.
