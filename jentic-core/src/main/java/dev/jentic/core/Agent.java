// 1. Agent Interface
// ============================================================================

/**
 * Core agent interface defining the lifecycle and basic operations of an agent
 * in the Jentic multi-agent framework.
 *
 * <p>All agents in Jentic must implement this interface, which provides the
 * fundamental contract for agent behavior, lifecycle management, and
 * inter-agent communication. An agent is an autonomous entity that can:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Execute behaviors independently</li>
 *   <li>Communicate with other agents via messages</li>
 *   <li>Be started and stopped asynchronously</li>
 *   <li>Manage its own lifecycle state</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><strong>Lifecycle:</strong> Agents follow a simple lifecycle model:
 * <ol>
 *   <li><strong>Created</strong> - Agent is instantiated but not running</li>
 *   <li><strong>Starting</strong> - {@link #start()} is called, behaviors are being initialized</li>
 *   <li><strong>Running</strong> - Agent is active, behaviors are executing</li>
 *   <li><strong>Stopping</strong> - {@link #stop()} is called, behaviors are being shut down</li>
 *   <li><strong>Stopped</strong> - Agent is inactive, can be restarted</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p><strong>Behaviors:</strong> Agents execute behaviors, which are units of
 * autonomous activity. Behaviors can be:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>One-shot (execute once)</li>
 *   <li>Cyclic (execute repeatedly)</li>
 *   <li>Triggered by messages or events</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><strong>Communication:</strong> Agents communicate through a
 * {@link MessageService}, which provides publish-subscribe messaging with
 * topic-based routing and point-to-point communication.
 *
 * <p><strong>Thread Safety:</strong> Implementations must be thread-safe.
 * Multiple behaviors may execute concurrently, and lifecycle methods may be
 * called from different threads.
 *
 * <p><strong>Error States:</strong> When an error occurs during lifecycle
 *  operations, the agent transitions to {@link AgentStatus#ERROR} state.
 *  The running flag is set to false, but the agent remains in the ERROR state
 *  rather than transitioning to STOPPED.
 *
 * <p><strong>Example Usage:</strong>
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Creating a simple agent
 * Agent agent = new MyCustomAgent("agent-1", "My Agent");
 *
 * // Adding behaviors
 * agent.addBehavior(new CyclicBehavior("monitor", this::monitorSystem));
 * agent.addBehavior(new MessageBehavior("handler", this::handleMessage));
 *
 * // Starting the agent asynchronously
 * agent.start().thenRun(() -> {
 *     System.out.println("Agent started: " + agent.getAgentName());
 * });
 *
 * // Later, stopping the agent
 * agent.stop().thenRun(() -> {
 *     System.out.println("Agent stopped");
 * });
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p><strong>Implementation Notes:</strong>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Implementations should provide common base functionality</li>
 *   <li>Use {@code @JenticAgent} annotation for automatic discovery</li>
 *   <li>Ensure proper cleanup in {@link #stop()} to release resources</li>
 *   <li>Handle failures gracefully during startup and shutdown</li>
 * </ul>
