# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Jentic project. ADRs are documents that capture important architectural decisions made during the development of the project, along with their context and consequences.

## How to Use This ADR Collection

### For Developers

1. **Before Making Architectural Changes**: Read relevant ADRs to understand current decisions
2. **When Proposing Changes**: Create new ADR or update existing one
3. **During Code Reviews**: Reference ADRs to justify architectural choices
4. **When Onboarding**: ADRs provide context for why things are built this way

### For Contributors

1. **Understanding Decisions**: ADRs explain the "why" behind architectural choices
2. **Proposing Alternatives**: Create ADR to document alternative approaches
3. **Maintaining Consistency**: Use ADRs to ensure consistent decision-making

### ADR Lifecycle

1. **Proposed**: New ADR under discussion
2. **Accepted**: Decision made and implemented
3. **Deprecated**: Superseded by newer decision
4. **Rejected**: Considered but not adopted

## ADR Template

When creating new ADRs, use this template:

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Title]

**Status**: [Proposed/Accepted/Deprecated/Rejected]  
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Authors**: [List of authors]  
**Replaces**: [ADR number if replacing an existing decision]  
**Replaced By**: [ADR number if this decision was superseded]  

## Context

[Describe the forces at play, including technological, political, social, and project local. These forces are probably in tension, and should be called out as such.]

## Decision

[State the architecture decision and provide rationale.]

## Rationale

### Pros
- [List benefits of this approach]

### Cons  
- [List drawbacks and trade-offs]

### Alternatives Considered
- **Alternative 1**: [Brief description and why it was rejected]
- **Alternative 2**: [Brief description and why it was rejected]

## Implementation

[Provide concrete examples, code snippets, or configuration that demonstrates the decision.]

## Consequences

### Positive
- [List positive consequences]

### Negative
- [List negative consequences]

### Neutral
- [List neutral consequences that are neither clearly positive nor negative]

## Compliance

[How will adherence to this decision be monitored and enforced?]

## Notes

[Any additional notes, references, or related information]
```

## Future ADRs

New ADRs will be created when architectural decisions are needed. ADRs are created on-demand, not planned in advance, to maintain flexibility and avoid premature commitments.

Common architectural topics that may require future ADRs include:
- Error handling strategies
- Configuration management approaches  
- Logging and observability patterns
- Testing strategies for distributed systems
- Plugin/extension architectures
- Security models and authentication
- Performance monitoring and profiling
- Deployment patterns and strategies

When a new architectural decision is required:
1. Assess if it warrants an ADR (significant impact, affects multiple components, long-term implications)
2. Create the ADR using the template above
3. Discuss with the team and stakeholders
4. Update this index when the ADR is accepted

## Decision History

### Major Architectural Phases

**Phase 1 - Foundation**
- Established core technology choices
- Defined modular architecture
- Set development principles

**Phase 2 - Implementation**
- Define implementation standards
- Establish quality practices
- Set operational guidelines

**Phase 3 - Enterprise - Future**
- Advanced features and extensibility
- Production-ready capabilities
- Enterprise integration patterns

### Technology Evolution

    G --> H[Future: Security Model]
```

### Decision Dependencies

- **ADR-001** (Java 21) enables **ADR-005** (Records)
- **ADR-002** (Interfaces) enables **ADR-004** (Progressive Complexity)
- **ADR-003** (Maven Modules) supports **ADR-002** (Interface Architecture)
- **ADR-006** (Annotations) builds on **ADR-005** (Message Format)
