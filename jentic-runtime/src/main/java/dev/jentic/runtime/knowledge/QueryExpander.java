/**
 * Expands search queries with synonyms to improve recall.
 *
 * <p>Synonym groups are registered at construction time (or lazily via
 * {@link #addSynonyms}). When {@link #expand} is called, every token in
 * the query that matches a known term is augmented with all its synonyms.
 * The expanded query can then be passed to {@link dev.jentic.core.knowledge.KnowledgeStore#search}.
 *
 * <p>Example:
 * <pre>{@code
 * QueryExpander expander = new QueryExpander();
 * expander.addSynonyms("refund", "return", "money back");
 * expander.addSynonyms("cancel", "cancellation", "void");
 *
 * String expanded = expander.expand("I want a refund");
 * // → "i want a refund return money back"
 *
 * List<KnowledgeDocument<...>> docs = store.search(expanded, 5);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Synonym matching is case-insensitive; the expanded query is lowercase.
 * This class is not thread-safe. If synonym groups are registered concurrently,
 * external synchronisation is required.
